Unit 14 Homework: Belly Button Biodiversity

Files:
    index.html -> To Launch
    app_dm.js -> javascript code that populates the dashboard
    samples.json -> the supplied file that contains the metadata


In this assignment, we were asked to build an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.
The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

* To complete the data exploration, the Plotly D3 Javascript library was used to create three visualizations for each subject in the trial. These visualizations are accessed via dropdown menu. 

* Additionally, each dropdown option includes the subject metadata persisting of ID, Ethnicity, Gender, Age, Location, Body Type, and Frequency of Washes.
